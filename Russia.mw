Ku Klux Klan
"KKK" redirects here. For other uses, see KKK (disambiguation).
The Ku Klux Klan /ˈkuː ˈklʌks ˈklæn, ˈkjuː/,[7] commonly called the KKK or simply the Klan, is the name of three distinct movements in the United States that have advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white supremacy, white nationalism, anti-immigration and—especially in later iterations—Nordicism,[8][9] anti-Catholicism[10][11] and antisemitism.[11] Historically, the KKK used terrorism—both physical assault and murder—against groups or individuals whom they opposed.[12] All three movements have called for the "purification" of American society and all are considered right-wing extremist organizations.[13][14][15][16]

A thermonuclear weapon is a second generation nuclear weapon design using a secondary nuclear fusion stage consisting of implosion tamper, fusion fuel, and sparkplug which is bombarded by the energy released by the detonation of a primary fission bomb within, compressing the fuel material (tritium, deuterium or lithium deuteride) and causing a fusion reaction. Some advanced designs use fast neutrons produced by this second stage to ignite a third fast fission or fusion stage. The fission bomb and fusion fuel are placed near each other in a special radiation-reflecting container called a radiation case that is designed to contain x-rays for as long as possible. The result is greatly increased explosive power when compared to single-stage fission weapons.
