Message from the President / PresidentMessage from the President
　Now that Japan is entering a turning point in various stages. We have constantly thought about what we need to keep Daedoku food contributing to society, and have developed business. In June 2012, as a group company of SanDelica Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Yamazaki Manufacturing Co., Ltd., we began to mark a new history.
Chairperson ph
　As the trade fare market, which is said to be 7 trillion yen, will continue to expand, the role we play will become even more important. Meanwhile, as the declining birthrate and the aging population is progressing, we are also in a difficult market environment, so we will make every effort to develop innovative technologies and new products that are pleasing to customers, taking full advantage of the scale merit of the industry's top class group companies.
Chairperson ph Message from the President
　In addition to the know-how of chilled food manufacturing that Daedeok Food has built up, as a Yamazaki bread group company, I want to challenge the change with wisdom and knowledge and to provide new value to the market. From such a thought, we have worked towards a positive attitude, and have made an effort to respond to customers' trust through the manufacture and sale of noodles, soups and soups.
President ph
　As we continue to change ourselves more rapidly in the future, we will continue to evolve on a daily basis by strengthening our food safety and health management system and developing real 5S activities through participation by all members. In accordance with Yamazaki's spirit of asking the world with products, we will continue to strive to improve quality and satisfy our customers by developing innovative technologies and develop new products.
